# SPE_Rule_Generator
This is a program with the goal of generating SPE style rules given a set 
of features, a language inventory, a list of sounds you would like to 
look at, and a set of words that exhibit the environments of the sound. 


Currently works on given test set, need to check other types of SPE rules.
In future developement, this would ideal determine possible allophones and
contrastive sounds without the need for user inputed parameters.
