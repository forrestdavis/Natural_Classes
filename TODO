Need to implement derivations

Switch from natural classes to something like ranked
generalizations that more and more narrowly define 
the phonetic properties of a sound

Rule generation is thus based on the most general features 
that are able to distinguish a group of sounds from its
other environments!!!!


Get data from PBase, Mielke


Steps:

- change contexts
- rewrite environment direction
- fix prune
- Rule generation should be possible for any underlying form given a set of allophones
